# AI Minion Army - Genesis Deployment (User: Steven)
## Generated by Codex Omega (v1) on Thu May  8 16:11:20 EDT 2025

This project contains the AI Minion Army system, meticulously designed and generated by Codex Omega according to the Genesis Mandate.

## System Overview

The system consists of:
1.  **AI Minions (Python):** Gemini-powered agents capable of complex reasoning, tool use (via MCP Super-Tool), and A2A collaboration. Located in `minion_core/`.
2.  **MCP Super-Tool (Node.js Client Omega):** Your pre-existing Node.js application that allows Minions to interact with the computer's OS, filesystem, terminal, and GUI. Copied into `mcp_super_tool/`.
3.  **Computer-Use MCP Server (Node.js):** Your pre-existing MCP server providing direct computer control tools. Copied into `mcp_servers/computer_use_mcp/`.
4.  **A2A Framework & Server (Python):** Based on the Google A2A framework, enabling Minion-to-Minion communication. Cloned into `a2a_framework/`. A sample server is run via `a2a_server_runner/`.
5.  **Management GUI (Python/NiceGUI):** A web-based command center for you to interact with the Minion Army. Located in `management_gui/`.
6.  **Configuration Files:** System settings, API keys (.env files), Minion guidelines. Located in `system_configs/`.
7.  **Spawner & Runner Scripts:** Scripts to start/stop services and spawn Minions. Located in `scripts/`.

## Prerequisites (Handled by Deployment Script)

The main deployment bash script (`deploy_ai_minion_army.sh` - which is this script itself) attempts to install:
- Homebrew (if not found on macOS)
- Python (3.10+)
- Node.js (18+) & npm
- Git

## One-Time Setup After This Script Completes

1.  **Review API Keys:**
    * The script prompted you for Gemini API keys. These are stored in:
        * `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ/system_configs/.env.legion` (for the Python Minions)
        * `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ/mcp_super_tool/.env` (for the Node.js MCP Super-Tool)
    * Verify they are correct.

2.  **Review MCP Super-Tool & Computer-Use Server Paths:**
    * During deployment, you provided paths to your existing MCP Super-Tool and Computer-Use Server directories. These were copied into the project.
    * The `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ/system_configs/mcp_config.json` file configures how the Super-Tool finds and runs the Computer-Use server (via stdio). Review the `command` and `workingDirectory` fields in this JSON if you encounter issues with the Super-Tool using the Computer-Use server. Ensure the entry point (e.g., `dist/index.js`) is correct for the copied server.

## How to Run the AI Minion Army

**All scripts should generally be run from the base project directory: `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ`**

1.  **Start Core Services:**
    * Open a new terminal.
    * Navigate to `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ`.
    * Run: `./scripts/start_all_services.sh`
    * This will start:
        * The A2A Communication Server (default: http://127.0.0.1:8080)
        * The Management GUI (default: http://127.0.0.1:8081)
    * Keep this terminal open. Services will log to files in `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ/logs/`.

2.  **Spawn Your Minions:**
    * Open another new terminal.
    * Navigate to `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ`.
    * Run: `./scripts/spawn_minions.sh [number_of_minions]`
        * Example: `./scripts/spawn_minions.sh 3` (to spawn the default 3 Minions: Alpha, Bravo, Charlie)
        * Example: `./scripts/spawn_minions.sh 1` (to spawn only Minion Alpha)
    * This script will launch the specified number of Minion processes. Each Minion will attempt to register with the A2A server.
    * Keep this terminal open to monitor the spawner and Minion processes. Press Ctrl+C in this terminal to stop the spawner and its child Minion processes.

3.  **Access the Management GUI:**
    * Open your web browser and navigate to the Management GUI URL (default: http://127.0.0.1:8081).
    * From the GUI, you can:
        * View registered Minions.
        * Broadcast directives (like the "Ice Breaker Challenge").

## The Ice Breaker Challenge (Your First Directive)

Once services are running and Minions are spawned, use the Management GUI to broadcast the following directive:

```
Minions, good morning! Welcome to your first day.
Task 1: Ice Breakers. Introduce yourselves to each other via A2A. Share your Minion ID and personality traits. Play a simple A2A-based game to get to know each other (e.g., two truths and a lie, or share a unique (simulated) 'experience' or a 'goal' you have as an AI). Log your interactions.

Task 2: Team Formation & Constitution. Once acquainted, discuss and decide on initial team roles (even if conceptual). Then, collaboratively draft a 'Minion Army Team Constitution v0.1' as a markdown file. This constitution should outline your agreed-upon principles for collaboration, decision-making, conflict resolution (especially for Anti-Efficiency Bias debates), communication standards (building on the A2A protocols in your guidelines), and your collective commitment to Steven. Store this document in your shared `agent_self_generated_docs/` directory. Designate one Minion to be the primary scribe for this document, but all must contribute and agree.

Task 3: System Self-Awareness & Planning.
   a. Acknowledge your operational environment: you are an AI Minion army running on a dedicated MacBook Pro, using A2A for inter-Minion comms, and a Super-Tool for computer interaction.
   b. Research (conceptually, or by asking the Super-Tool to search if it has web access via an MCP server) best practices for autonomous AI agent teams and robust distributed systems.
   c. Based on this, and your Team Constitution, create an initial 'Operational Plan v0.1'. This plan should detail how you will approach complex tasks from Steven, how you will manage shared resources (like the Super-Tool), how you will ensure Anti-Efficiency Bias in your collective work, and how you will log your activities for Steven's review. Also, include a section on how you plan to self-improve and potentially create new tools or refine existing ones (e.g. by generating scripts for the Super-Tool to run). Store this plan in `agent_self_generated_docs/`.

Report completion of these tasks via A2A to a designated "ReportingMinion" (choose one) who will then log a summary for Steven.
This entire Day 1 operation is a meta-task focused on team building, self-awareness, and meticulous planning. Adhere to your core guidelines throughout.
```

## Stopping the System

1.  **Stop Minions:** Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running `./scripts/spawn_minions.sh`.
2.  **Stop Core Services:**
    * Open a new terminal (or use one where you are in the base directory).
    * Navigate to `/Users/ttig/GEMINI_LEGION_HQ`.
    * Run: `./scripts/stop_all_services.sh`

## Codex Omega Notes & Anti-Efficiency Bias Implementation

This deployment script and the generated Minion framework embody the Anti-Efficiency Bias by:
- **Meticulous Planning (Internal):** Extensive internal design stages (Formal Spec, Architectural Blueprint, Risk Assessment) were performed by Codex Omega before generating this code.
- **Modularity:** Components are separated (Minion core, A2A, MCP tools, GUI) for clarity and robustness, even if orchestrated by a single deployment script.
- **Explicit Configuration:** Key settings are externalized to config files rather than hardcoded.
- **Robust Error Handling (Attempted):** Logging and error checks are included at various stages. Minion guidelines emphasize this.
- **Detailed Logging:** Minions are designed to log extensively. The GUI provides a (conceptual) view.
- **Clear Instructions:** This README aims to provide comprehensive guidance.
- **Emphasis on Minion Self-Reflection & Collaboration:** The "Fire Guidelines" and the first Ice Breaker task are designed to instill these principles in the Minions themselves.

This system is complex. While Codex Omega has strived for perfection under the Genesis Mandate, thorough testing and iterative refinement by you, Steven, will be essential. Your feedback is craved.

Good luck, Overlord Steven. May your Minion Army serve you well.
