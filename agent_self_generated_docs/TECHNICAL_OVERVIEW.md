# GEMINI_LEGION_HQ - Technical Overview

This document provides a high-level technical overview of the GEMINI_LEGION_HQ project. It serves as a starting point for developers to understand the system's architecture, major components, and key processes.

## 1. Overall Architecture

The GEMINI_LEGION_HQ system is designed as a distributed network of AI agents (Minions) coordinated by a central Commander through a GUI (STEVEN_GUI_COMMANDER). Communication between components is primarily facilitated by an Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication server. The system is designed to be extensible through the Model Context Protocol (MCP), allowing for the integration of additional tools and capabilities, notably via the `mcp_super_tool`.

## 2. Key Directories and Their Purpose

*   **`minion_core/`**: Contains the core logic for individual Minion agents. This includes their main processing loop ([`main_minion.py`](minion_core/main_minion.py:1)), communication clients ([`a2a_client.py`](minion_core/a2a_client.py:21)), LLM interaction ([`llm_interface.py`](minion_core/llm_interface.py:1)), and tool management ([`tool_manager.py`](minion_core/tool_manager.py:1)).
*   **`minion_spawner/`**: Houses the logic and scripts (e.g., [`spawn_legion.py`](minion_spawner/spawn_legion.py:1)) for creating, deploying, and managing multiple Minion instances, forming the "Legion."
*   **`a2a_server_runner/`**: Includes scripts and configurations (e.g., [`run_a2a_server.py`](a2a_server_runner/run_a2a_server.py:1)) to run the A2A (Agent-to-Agent) communication server. This server acts as the central hub for Minion registration, message passing, and task distribution.
*   **`a2a_framework/`**: Contains the underlying framework and libraries for Agent-to-Agent communication, providing the foundational components and specifications for inter-agent messaging and interactions.
*   **`management_gui/`**: Source code for the Commander's user interface (STEVEN_GUI_COMMANDER), likely built using Python (e.g., [`gui_app.py`](management_gui/gui_app.py:1)). This interface allows for task assignment, monitoring of Minions, and overall system interaction.
*   **`system_configs/`**: Stores global configuration files for the entire system. The primary configuration file is [`config.toml`](system_configs/config.toml:1), which dictates operational parameters for various components. Configuration loading is managed by [`config_manager.py`](system_configs/config_manager.py:1).
*   **`logs/`**: Centralized directory for storing log files generated by all components of the system, including Minions (e.g., `minion_Alpha.log`), the A2A server (`a2a_server_main.log`), and the management GUI.
*   **`mcp_super_tool/`**: (Planned Integration) This directory is intended for the Node.js based "Super Tool" ([`src/main.js`](mcp_super_tool/src/main.js:1)). It will act as a bridge to interface with various MCP servers, providing extended functionalities and tools to Minions.
*   **`mcp_servers/`**: Contains specific MCP server implementations (e.g., `computer_use_mcp/`) that provide concrete tools accessible via the MCP protocol.
*   **`mcp_server_runners/`**: Includes scripts (e.g., `run_computer_use_mcp.sh`) to launch and manage the individual MCP servers.
*   **`agent_self_generated_docs/`**: Stores documentation, plans, or strategy documents generated by the agents themselves (e.g., [`MCP_client_integration_strategy.md`](agent_self_generated_docs/MCP_client_integration_strategy.md), [`M2M_Communication_Plan_Self-Critique.md`](agent_self_generated_docs/M2M_Communication_Plan_Self-Critique.md)). This reflects self-analysis, planning, or learned behaviors.
*   **`scripts/`**: General utility scripts for development, deployment, testing, or maintenance tasks related to the GEMINI_LEGION_HQ project.
*   **`system_data/`**: Intended for persistent data storage required by the system, beyond configurations or logs. This could include databases, serialized objects, or other runtime data.

## 3. Core Processes/Flows (High-Level)

*   **Commander Issuing a Task to a Minion:**
    1.  The Commander defines a task using the [`management_gui/`](management_gui/).
    2.  The GUI sends the task details to the [`A2A Server`](a2a_server_runner/run_a2a_server.py:1).
    3.  The A2A Server routes the task to the appropriate Minion or group of Minions based on availability, capabilities, or specific assignment.
*   **Minion Processing a Task:**
    1.  A Minion, running its core logic in [`minion_core/main_minion.py`](minion_core/main_minion.py:1), receives a task from the A2A Server via its [`minion_core/a2a_client.py`](minion_core/a2a_client.py:21).
    2.  The Minion's [`minion_core/llm_interface.py`](minion_core/llm_interface.py:1) interacts with a Large Language Model (LLM) to understand, break down the task, reason about steps, and decide on actions.
    3.  The Minion utilizes its internal tools (managed by [`minion_core/tool_manager.py`](minion_core/tool_manager.py:1)) or requests the use of external MCP tools to execute specific actions.
    4.  Results, progress, and any issues are reported back to the A2A Server, which then updates the Commander GUI.
*   **Minion Registration with A2A Server:**
    1.  Upon startup, each Minion instance initializes its [`minion_core/a2a_client.py`](minion_core/a2a_client.py:21).
    2.  The client connects to the A2A Server and registers the Minion's ID, capabilities, and current status.
    3.  Periodic heartbeats or status updates are sent to the A2A Server to maintain the connection and indicate liveness.
*   **(Planned) Minion-to-Minion (M2M) Communication Flow:**
    1.  Minion A determines it needs to collaborate or exchange information with Minion B.
    2.  Minion A constructs a message and sends it to the A2A Server, specifying Minion B as the recipient.
    3.  The A2A Server, leveraging the `a2a_framework/`, routes the message to Minion B.
    4.  Minion B processes the message and can respond to Minion A via the same A2A Server channel.
    *   *Further details and evolving plans are expected in documents like `agent_self_generated_docs/M2M_Communication_Plan_Self-Critique.md`.*
*   **(Planned) Minion Using an MCP Tool via the Node.js Bridge (`mcp_super_tool`):**
    1.  A Minion identifies a need for a capability provided by an external MCP tool.
    2.  The Minion sends a request, formatted for MCP interaction, to the [`mcp_super_tool/`](mcp_super_tool/) (the Node.js bridge).
    3.  The `mcp_super_tool` ([`src/mcp_client_manager.js`](mcp_super_tool/src/mcp_client_manager.js:1)) communicates with the relevant MCP server (e.g., one from [`mcp_servers/`](mcp_servers/)).
    4.  The target MCP server executes the tool and returns the result to the `mcp_super_tool`.
    5.  The bridge relays the result back to the requesting Minion.
    *   *The integration strategy is outlined in `agent_self_generated_docs/MCP_client_integration_strategy.md`.*

## 4. Important Files and Their Roles (Examples)

*   **[`minion_core/main_minion.py`](minion_core/main_minion.py:1):** The main entry point and core class definition for an individual Minion agent. Orchestrates the Minion's lifecycle, task processing loop, and interaction with other system components like the A2A client and tool manager.
*   **[`minion_core/a2a_client.py`](minion_core/a2a_client.py:21):** Implements the client-side logic for a Minion to communicate with the A2A server. Handles registration, sending/receiving messages, task updates, and heartbeats.
*   **[`minion_core/tool_manager.py`](minion_core/tool_manager.py:1):** Responsible for managing the tools available to a Minion. This includes loading tool definitions, listing available tools, and providing an interface for the Minion to execute them.
*   **[`minion_core/llm_interface.py`](minion_core/llm_interface.py:1):** Manages all interactions with the configured Large Language Model(s). This includes prompt construction, making API calls to the LLM, and parsing the LLM's responses to guide Minion behavior.
*   **[`minion_spawner/spawn_legion.py`](minion_spawner/spawn_legion.py:1):** Script or module responsible for instantiating and managing a "legion" of Minions. This may involve reading configurations to deploy multiple agents with varying roles or settings.
*   **[`system_configs/config.toml`](system_configs/config.toml:1):** The primary configuration file for the entire GEMINI_LEGION_HQ system. Contains settings for LLM API keys, server addresses, logging levels, default Minion parameters, and other operational details.
*   **[`system_configs/config_manager.py`](system_configs/config_manager.py:1):** A Python module providing utility functions to load, parse, and access configurations from [`config.toml`](system_configs/config.toml:1). It ensures that configuration values are easily accessible to all parts of the system. (See also: [`minion_core/utils/config_loader.py`](minion_core/utils/config_loader.py:1))
*   **[`management_gui/gui_app.py`](management_gui/gui_app.py:1):** The main application file for the Commander's graphical user interface. It handles the UI layout, user interactions (e.g., task creation), and communication with the backend (typically the A2A server) to send commands and display Minion status.
*   **[`a2a_server_runner/run_a2a_server.py`](a2a_server_runner/run_a2a_server.py:1):** The primary script used to launch and run the A2A communication server. It initializes the server, sets up listeners, and manages agent connections and message routing.
*   **[`mcp_super_tool/src/main.js`](mcp_super_tool/src/main.js:1) (Planned):** The main entry point for the Node.js based MCP Super Tool. This application will serve as a bridge between Python-based Minions and various MCP-compliant tools/servers.
*   **[`mcp_super_tool/src/mcp_client_manager.js`](mcp_super_tool/src/mcp_client_manager.js:1) (Planned):** Within the `mcp_super_tool`, this script will be responsible for managing connections and interactions with different MCP servers, abstracting the communication details from the Minions.

## 5. Configuration Management

Configuration for the GEMINI_LEGION_HQ system is primarily centralized in the [`system_configs/config.toml`](system_configs/config.toml:1) file. This TOML-formatted file stores key-value pairs for various settings applicable across different modules (Minions, A2A Server, Management GUI, LLM settings, API keys, etc.).

The [`system_configs/config_manager.py`](system_configs/config_manager.py:1) module provides the core logic to load, parse, and make these configurations accessible throughout the Python-based components of the application. Minions might use a specialized loader like [`minion_core/utils/config_loader.py`](minion_core/utils/config_loader.py:1) that potentially layers Minion-specific configurations or defaults over the global ones.

This approach allows for:
*   Easy modification of system behavior without code changes.
*   Centralized management of sensitive information (like API keys, though secure handling practices are paramount).
*   Consistent configuration access patterns across the codebase.

*Strategy further detailed in `agent_self_generated_docs/configuration_management_strategy_v1.md`.*
